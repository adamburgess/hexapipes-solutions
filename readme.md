# Hexapipes Solutions

[Hexapipes](https://github.com/gereleth/hexapipes) is a fun game.

I wrote a program to solve them. Soon to be open sourced.
In the meantime, here are the solutions.

At the moment, my program takes approximately 42 seconds to solve all 15,000 puzzles on a 6700k.
Optimisation is needed to reduce this further. 40x40 wrap puzzle takes the majority of that time.

For reference on what the numbers in each tile means, see this:
